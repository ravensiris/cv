## Check it out!

Latest version [HERE](https://github.com/ravensiris/cv/releases/download/v2.0/cv.pdf)

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your system, this can also be obtained via [Docker](https://docker.com).

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ make
```

Results should be at the `out` directory

Or using docker:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD":/doc thomasweise/texlive make
```
